# Loxtep for Codex

**Loxtep is the AI-first, governed data layer for your business. Build agents in OpenAI Codex; Loxtep ingests your data, gives them trustworthy context, and governs every access over hosted MCP.**

[Loxtep](https://loxtep.io) handles the data underneath your agents. Connect a source — Postgres, Shopify, Stripe, a webhook — and Loxtep ingests it into **governed data products** (versioned, with schema, lineage, and quality) that your agents query over MCP, with **audit and field masking on by default**. No pipelines to hand-roll, no field names to invent.

Because AI agents need more than API access, Loxtep maintains a **semantic layer, ontology, and runtime context** (entity knowledge, decision traces, process graphs) that your Codex agent can query and extend.

This directory connects Codex to that platform: hosted MCP, OAuth, and scoped skills.

This directory lives in the [loxtep-plugins-skills](https://github.com/LoxtepInc/loxtep-plugins-skills) repo under `codex/`.

## What makes Loxtep different

| Generic workflow tool | Loxtep |
| --- | --- |
| Pipelines as the unit of work | **Data products** — owned, versioned, cataloged assets with contracts and SLAs |
| Batch ETL / cron jobs | **Event streaming** — real-time data movement |
| Docs about data definitions | **Semantic layer + ontology** — canonical terms agents can resolve |
| "The AI read our wiki" | **AI context** — entity context, decision traces, process intelligence |
| Security as an afterthought | **Data governance by design** — RBAC, PII, quality, lineage |
| Opaque data sprawl | **Discovery** — catalog, evidence, lineage impact, governance flags |

## Key concepts

- **Data product** — Governed, discoverable dataset with schema, lineage, quality, and delivery.
- **Streaming** — Events in real time; workflows implement the flow.
- **Semantic layer** — Business meaning agents query instead of inventing field names.
- **AI context** — Entity knowledge, decisions, processes exposed over MCP.
- **Governance** — Permissions, PII, quality, and lineage enforced at build and access time.

## Prerequisites

- **Loxtep account** with `owner`, `org_admin`, or `developer` role (for MCP tool access)
- Project-scoped operations require `project_id` (call `get_current_user` first)

## Install

### 1. MCP server

Edit `~/.codex/config.toml` (or project `.codex/config.toml`) and add the snippet from `config.snippet.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.loxtep]
url = "https://mcp.loxtep.io/ai/mcp/stream"
```

See [Codex MCP](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp) and [config reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference).

### 2. Authenticate

OAuth runs on first use. To log in explicitly:

```bash
codex mcp login loxtep
```

### 3. Install skills

Codex discovers skills from `~/.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -r codex/skills/* ~/.agents/skills/
```

Optionally add project norms to `AGENTS.md` — see [Codex AGENTS.md guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md).

> **Dev environment:** `https://mcpdev.loxtep.io/ai/mcp/stream`

## Developer workflows

1. **Orient** — session + RBAC; catalog/semantic layer search.
2. **Ingest** — connector → connection → workflow graph (streaming).
3. **Productize** — governed data products with schema and lineage.
4. **Govern** — PII, quality, semantics, ontology.
5. **Consume** — webhooks, SDK.
6. **Context for AI** — entity context, decision traces.
7. **Ship & debug** — deploy, runtime mapping, queue tracing.

## Example prompts

- "Search the semantic layer for how we define churn"
- "Create a source data product for Shopify orders and tag email as PII"
- "Show lineage impact if we deprecate unified_orders"
- "Trace deployment errors on the queue"

## What you get

### Loxtep Customer MCP
